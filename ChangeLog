	* Template.pm: Version 1.03.
	
	Code added to support HASH option to fill_in.
	(Incl. `_gensym' function.)
	
	Documentation for HASH.
	
	New test file for HASH.
	
	Note about failure of lexical variables to propagate into
 	templates.  Why does this surprise people?
	
	Bug fix: program fragments are evaluated in an environment with
 	`no strict' by default.  Otherwise, you get a lot of `Global
 	symbol "$v" requires explicit package name' failures.  Why didn't
 	the test program pick this up?  Because the only variable the test
 	program ever used was `$a', which is exempt.  Duhhhhh.
	
	Fixed the test program.
	
	Various minor documentation fixes.

This is the long-promised update of Text::Template.

It is actually a complete rewrite.  The new version delivers better
functionality but is only 2/3 as long, which I think is a good sign.
It is supposed to be 100% backward-compatible with the previous
versions.  With one cosmetic change, it passes the test suite that the
previous versions passed.

New features:

*     At least twice as fast 

*     Better support for filling out the same template more than once 

*     Now supports evaluation of program fragments in Safe
      compartments. (Thanks, Jonathan!)  

*     Better argument syntax 

*     More convenience functions 

*     The parser is much better and simpler. 

*     Once a template is parsed, the parsed version is stored so that
      it needn't be parsed again.  

*     BROKEN function behavior is rationalized. You can now pass an
      arbitrary argument to your BROKEN function, or return a value
      from it to the main program.  

*     Documentation overhauled.

What's new in v1.03:

	Code added to support HASH option to fill_in.
	(Incl. `_gensym' function.)
	
	Documentation for HASH.
	
	New test file for HASH.
	
	Note about failure of lexical variables to propagate into
 	templates.  Why does this surprise people?
	
	Bug fix: program fragments are evaluated in an environment with
 	`no strict' by default.  Otherwise, you get a lot of `Global
 	symbol "$v" requires explicit package name' failures.  Why didn't
 	the test program pick this up?  Because the only variable the test
 	program ever used was `$a', which is exempt.  Duhhhhh.
	
	Fixed the test program.
	
	Various minor documentation fixes.

This is the long-promised update of Text::Template.

It is actually a complete rewrite.  The new version delivers better
functionality but is only 2/3 as long, which I think is a good sign.
It is supposed to be 100% backward-compatible with the previous
versions.  With one cosmetic change, it passes the test suite that the
previous versions passed.

New features:

* Better argument syntax

* At least twice as fast

* Better support for filling out the same template more than once

* More convenience functions

In particular, the parser is much better and simpler, and once a
template is parsed, the parsed version is stored so that it needn't be
parsed again.
